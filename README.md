# pokecraft-origins
# Just a side project combining two of my most notable interests, origins and pokemon! Some friends wanted to play Cobblemon and origins together so I said aight bet and started working on this in the middle of midterms, like the very well-restrained person I am. I'll be doing releases in waves of 3, meaning three new pokemon origins per release.
I'm very inexperienced with how github works and with posting my non-art projects anywhere other than discord servers, so be patient with me!
